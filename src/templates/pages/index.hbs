                    <p>Beyond academics, there's something that draws Bethel students together. It's a sense of calling, a commitment to shared values, and a deep desire to fulfill a greater purpose.</p>
                    <p>You’ll be challenged to think critically about your convictions and consider some of life’s most difficult questions from a Christian perspective. And when you take your place in our increasingly diverse world, you’ll know what it means to own your faith and live for something more.</p>
