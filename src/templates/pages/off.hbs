                <p>SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having
                asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from

                island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I

                shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with
                black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid
                white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself
                as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so
                often afterwards:</p>
