            <h1>Treasure Island</h1>

            <p>SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having
            asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from
            the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the
            island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I
            take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when
            my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the
            sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.</p>
            <p>I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the
            inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrowâ€”a
            tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the
            shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with
            black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid
            white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself
            as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so
            often afterwards:</p>
