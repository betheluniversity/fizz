                                <p>While interviewing with a Bethel alum for a position at UnitedHealth Group, the interviewer asked me to consider
                                    joining the International Audit department instead of the position for which I had applied. So, it’s safe to say that my career path was undeniably influenced
                                    by Bethel and this wonderful alum who decided to take a chance on me – not just once, but twice.</p>
